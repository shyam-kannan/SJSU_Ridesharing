# Grouping Service

## Purpose

The Grouping Service handles intelligent carpool group formation and optimization:

- Smart passenger-to-trip matching
- Carpool group formation based on routes
- Optimization algorithms for maximum efficiency
- Group compatibility scoring
- Route deviation calculation
- Multi-passenger pickup/drop-off optimization
- Dynamic regrouping for recurring trips
- Group preferences matching

## Technology

- Python (for optimization algorithms)
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data
- Redis for caching
- Machine learning for preference matching

## Key Features

- Intelligent matching algorithms
- Route optimization for multiple passengers
- Compatibility scoring based on preferences
- Real-time group suggestions
- Minimize detour time for all parties
- Support for recurring carpool groups
- Group member preferences
- Cost optimization

## Algorithms

- Shortest path with multiple waypoints
- Passenger-trip matching score
- Time window optimization
- Preference-based filtering

## API Endpoints

Details to be added during implementation.
